Issues : </br>
1) The fire alarm system helps to solve the problem of temperature problems, thanks to the use of temperature sensors</br>
2) I already know a bit about threading and so an alternative and better version of the same program can be created if the same program is used. It may have freed the terminal space and it will notify the user whenever the temperature in the space measured by the sensor is higher than the normal temperature the system will immediately alarm and display it. screen, allowing us to handle the situation when a fire occurs. </br></br>
